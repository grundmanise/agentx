# CLI contract

Status: accepted, 2026-09-18. Implements the output contract in ADR 0001 and the machine state layout in ADR 0004. The desktop app, scripts and tests depend on this document; change it together with the CLI.

## Invocation

`agentx [--json] [--verbose] <command> [arguments]`. The two global flags are accepted before or after the command. `--json` switches stdout to newline-delimited JSON events. `--verbose` raises the log level on stderr to debug. `agentx help`, `--help`, `-h` and a bare `agentx` print usage and exit 0; the usage text goes to stdout, or to stderr in JSON mode. A bare `agentx --json` is a usage error instead: a script that omits the command has made a mistake.

The CLI reads its environment once, at startup, from the variables below. Nothing else in the environment changes its behaviour.

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTX_HOME` | agentx home | `$HOME/.agentx` |
| `AGENTX_LIBRARY` | the library | `$HOME/.agents/skills` |
| `HOME` | the user's home; agent client paths derive from it | required |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | where agent clients keep user-scope configuration | `$HOME/.config` |
| `AGENTX_PLATFORM_ID` | the platform id the machine id is derived from; set it empty to declare that the machine has none | the operating system's platform id, see [Machine identity](#machine-identity) |
| `AGENTX_HOSTNAME` | the default machine label | the operating system's hostname |

## Streams

Without `--json`, stdout carries plain aligned text and stderr carries log lines as `level: message`.

With `--json`, stdout carries only events, one JSON object per line, and nothing else. Stderr carries log events in the same envelope. A consumer reads the exit code before trusting either stream.

## Event envelope

Every event is one JSON object with at least:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | string | the event type |
| `schema_version` | integer | the output schema version, currently `1` |

`schema_version` changes when an event changes incompatibly. A consumer refuses a CLI whose schema version it does not know.

## Event types

Every run emits exactly one `result` as its last stdout event, after any `error`.

`version`, emitted by `agentx version`:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `cli_version` | string | the CLI version, `dev` for an unreleased build |

`settings`, emitted by every `agentx config` command:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `settings` | object | the machine settings as they now are, in the shape of the settings file below, with `label` filled in from the hostname when it is not set |

`machine`, emitted by every `agentx machine` command:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | the machine id, 32 lowercase hex characters |
| `label` | string | the machine label |
| `derivation` | string | `platform` when the id is derived from the platform id, `random` when it comes from `machine.json` |

`error`, emitted when a command fails:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | string | the string code of the exit code table below |
| `message` | string | what went wrong, naming the path or command involved |
| `hint` | string | how to fix it; absent when there is nothing to suggest |

`result`, the terminating event:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | boolean | whether the command succeeded; the exit code is 0 exactly when it is `true` |
| `summary` | string | one line about the outcome; on failure the error message; absent when empty |

`log`, written to stderr:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `level` | string | the log level; `debug` lines appear only with `--verbose` |
| `message` | string | the log line |

The other event types are `progress`, `snapshot`, `reconcile`, `configuration`, `skill`, `mcp_server`, `plugin`, `doctor`, `search`, `refresh_complete`, `drift`, `update_available` and `conflict`. Their fields are added to this document by the command that first emits them. `operation` and `fleet` are reserved and never emitted.

## Exit codes

| Exit | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `ok` | success |
| 1 | `usage` | a usage error: unknown command, bad flag, missing argument or a required environment variable not set |
| 2 | `git` | git is missing or older than 2.40 |
| 3 | `source` | a source is unreachable or authentication failed |
| 4 | `pending_merge` | a pending merge blocks the action |
| 5 | `not_found` | a skill, source or configuration was not found |
| 6 | `refused` | a collision or an unmet precondition |
| 7 | `locked` | another agentx command holds the lock |
| 8 | `account_repo` | the account repo is unusable: missing, corrupt, or a repository format this git cannot read |
| 10 | `internal` | an internal error, including an unreadable settings file |

In JSON mode the `error` event carries the code as its `code` field.

## Agentx home

Everything the CLI keeps on the machine lives under agentx home. Durable entries survive a reinstall when the directory is retained; transient entries coordinate running commands; derived entries are rebuilt from what the machine already has.

```
~/.agentx/
  account.git/        durable   bare account repo: skills/<name> forks, managed/<name> import branches,
                                refs/agentx/merge/<name> pending merges, refs/agentx/candidate/<name>
                                update candidates, refs/agentx/sources/<id> the last fetched state of each source
  worktrees/<name>/   durable   one linked worktree per placed fork
  settings.json       durable   machine settings
  mutations/<id>.json durable   local mutation journal, kept until completion or recovery
  sync.json           durable   fleet upload protocol metadata; reserved, nothing writes it today
  ops/<ulid>.json     durable   operation records; reserved, nothing writes them today
  version             transient mutation counter, rewritten last by every mutating command
  lock                transient advisory lock: shared for local scans, exclusive for mutations and recovery
  machine.json        derived   the machine id, only where no platform identity exists
  handshakes.json     derived   last MCP signature per server
```

No agent client reads anything in agentx home except the fork worktrees, through symlinks from the library. There is no logs directory: logs go to stderr. Temporary worktrees for editor sessions live in the operating system's temporary directory.

## Machine settings

`settings.json` in agentx home holds what only this machine decides. It is read whole and written by temp file, fsync and rename while the lock is held. A missing file means defaults. An unreadable file is exit code 10 with a hint naming the path.

`agentx config list` prints every setting, `agentx config get <key>` one, and `agentx config set <key> <value>` changes `label`, `auto_push` or `accept_operations`; the booleans take `true` or `false`. An unknown key, a key that `config set` cannot change, or an invalid value is exit code 1 with a hint listing the keys. Without `--json`, `list` prints a `key  value` table and `get` prints the bare value.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "label": "my-laptop",
  "auto_push": false,
  "accept_operations": false,
  "enabled_configurations": ["claude-code", "cursor"],
  "sources": [
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/example/skills",
      "alias": "https://github.com/example/skills-old",
      "pin": "v1.2.0",
      "last_fetched": "2026-09-18T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "copy_mode": {
    "my-skill": ["cursor"]
  }
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema_version` | the settings schema version, currently `1` |
| `label` | the machine label; absent until set with `config set label` or `machine rename`, and reported as the hostname meanwhile |
| `auto_push` | whether published forks are pushed automatically |
| `accept_operations` | reserved; whether this machine executes operations queued for it |
| `enabled_configurations` | configuration ids selected by default for explicit placements; every detected configuration is enabled on first detection |
| `sources` | each source by canonical `url`, with optional `alias` (a second URL mapped to the canonical one), optional `pin` (a ref the source is held at) and `last_fetched` (RFC 3339) |
| `copy_mode` | skill name to the configuration ids that receive a copy instead of a symlink |

Git config in the account repo holds only what git owns: remotes and tracking branches.

## Machine identity

The machine id names one computer across reinstalls. It is derived, in this order:

1. When `machine.json` exists in agentx home, its `id` is the machine id and the derivation is `random`. The file is `{"id": "<32 lowercase hex characters>"}`.
2. Otherwise, when a platform id exists, the machine id is HMAC-SHA256 with the key `agentx-machine-id/v1` over the message `<platform id> LF <uid>`, where `LF` is one newline byte and `<uid>` is the numeric user id in decimal, rendered as the first 32 lowercase hex characters of the MAC. The derivation is `platform`. The platform id is `AGENTX_PLATFORM_ID` when the variable is set, else the content of `/etc/machine-id` without surrounding whitespace on Linux, else `IOPlatformUUID` from `ioreg -rd1 -c IOPlatformExpertDevice` on macOS.
3. Otherwise 16 random bytes are generated once, under the lock, stored as hex in `machine.json`, and used from then on as in 1.

`agentx machine` prints the id, the label and the derivation. `agentx machine rename <label>` sets the label in the settings file. `agentx machine reset-id` writes a new random id to `machine.json`; from then on the id is random even where a platform id exists, until the file is deleted.

## Lock and version file

Every command that changes agentx home takes an exclusive advisory `flock` on `lock` in agentx home without waiting, does its writes, rewrites `version` as its last step and releases the lock. `version` holds one decimal integer and a newline, incremented on every successful mutation (a missing file counts as 0); it is a change signal for watchers, not an ordering of snapshots. A command that finds the lock held exits at once with code 7 and a hint naming the lock file. While it holds the lock, a command keeps its process id in the lock file, so `agentx doctor` can name the holder. A failed mutation leaves `version` untouched. Reading commands do not take the lock, except `agentx machine` for the one write that stores a random id; that write does not touch `version`. Taking the lock creates agentx home and its `ops` directory when they are missing; nothing writes into `ops` yet.

## Content hash

The content hash identifies one version of a skill by its content. It is SHA-256 over the following byte sequence, where `NUL` is one zero byte:

1. the frontmatter `name`, then `NUL`;
2. the frontmatter `description`, then `NUL`;
3. for every regular file under the skill directory, in bytewise order of its relative path with `/` as the separator: the relative path, `NUL`, the byte length in decimal, `NUL`, the file bytes.

A missing name or description contributes empty bytes. A symlink inside the skill is followed when it resolves inside the skill directory and skipped with a warning otherwise. File modes and times do not contribute. The hash is rendered as a short type prefix and lowercase hex; the prefix is fixed by the command that first emits it.

## Git

The CLI runs the system git as a subprocess and never embeds a git implementation. Git is located through `PATH` of the environment the CLI was given. The floor is git 2.40, compared by numeric version components, so 2.4 and 2.39 are rejected and 2.100 is accepted. Before any command other than `version`, `doctor` and `help` runs, the CLI runs `git --version` once; a missing or too-old git is exit code 2 with a hint naming the distribution package where known, before the command does anything. `version` and `doctor` stay available to report the problem.

Every git call names its repository with `--git-dir` explicitly, captures stdout and stderr, and logs the command line and stderr at debug level. Git runs in one of two environments, built from the CLI's own environment:

- Isolated, for every command that writes objects or merges: `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` points at `/dev/null`, `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`, every `GIT_*` variable of the user's is dropped, author and committer are fixed to `agentx <agentx@localhost>` at `946684800 +0000`, and `core.autocrlf=false`, `commit.gpgsign=false` and `core.hooksPath=/dev/null` are passed with `-c`. A commit made this way has the same id on every machine whatever the user's git configuration.
- User, for network commands: the CLI's environment as is, so credential helpers, SSH configuration and URL rewrites apply. agentx never stores git credentials.

In the serve child every git call additionally has `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `-o BatchMode=yes` appended to the SSH command and `GIT_ASKPASS=/bin/false`, so a prompt becomes an error rather than a hang.

## Doctor

`agentx doctor` checks whether this machine can run agentx and reports one row per check, in this order:

| Check | Statuses | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `git` | `ok`, `fail` | git is in `PATH` and 2.40 or newer; the detail names the version |
| `merge_tree` | `ok`, `fail` | `git merge-tree --write-tree --merge-base=<base> <ours> <theirs>` merges two branches of a throwaway repository in the temporary directory, made with deterministic commits |
| `relative_worktree_paths` | `info` | whether git is 2.48 or newer, which enables relative worktree paths |
| `isolated_commit` | `ok`, `fail` | the isolated environment gives a fixed input the known commit id `5d75017e77f5413f4337ef776244b8d8dc77ca90` |
| `home` | `ok`, `fail` | agentx home exists, or was created, and is writable |
| `lock` | `ok`, `warn` | the lock is free, or held by another agentx command; the detail names the holder's process id |
| `settings` | `ok`, `fail` | `settings.json` parses, or does not exist yet; the detail and hint name the path |
| `account_repo` | `ok`, `fail` | the account repo opens, or was created by this run |
| `library` | `ok`, `warn` | the library directory exists; a missing library is a warning, not a failure |

`doctor`, one event per check:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `check` | string | the check name from the table above |
| `status` | string | `ok`, `warn`, `fail` or `info` |
| `detail` | string | what was found, naming the version, path or error involved |
| `hint` | string | how to fix it; absent when there is nothing to suggest |

Without `--json` the same rows print as a `check  status  detail  hint` table. Exit code 2 when git is missing or too old; the run stops after the `git` row, since nothing else can be checked. Exit code 8 when the account repo is unusable, after every row. Exit code 7 when the account repo has to be created and another command holds the lock. Otherwise 0, warnings included. The `result` event carries `ok: false` exactly when the exit code is non-zero.

## Account repo

The account repo is `account.git` in agentx home, a bare repository. It is created on first use, under the lock, by the first command that opens it; `agentx doctor` is that command on a fresh machine. Creation runs `git init --bare` in the isolated environment and sets `gc.auto=0` (maintenance runs on the serve child's timer, never inside a command), `core.logAllRefUpdates=true` (reflogs, which a bare repository lacks by default), `merge.conflictStyle=zdiff3` and, on git 2.48 or newer, `worktree.useRelativePaths=true`. The repository is renamed into place only once every step succeeded. A present `account.git` that is not a bare repository git can read is exit code 8 with a hint naming the path.
