# CLI contract

Status: accepted, 2026-09-18. Implements the output contract in ADR 0001 and the machine state layout in ADR 0004. The desktop app, scripts and tests depend on this document; change it together with the CLI.

## Invocation

`agentx [--json] [--verbose] <command> [arguments]`. The two global flags are accepted before or after the command. `--json` switches stdout to newline-delimited JSON events. `--verbose` raises the log level on stderr to debug. `agentx help`, `--help`, `-h` and a bare `agentx` print usage and exit 0; the usage text goes to stdout, or to stderr in JSON mode. A bare `agentx --json` is a usage error instead: a script that omits the command has made a mistake.

The CLI reads its environment once, at startup, from the variables below. Nothing else in the environment changes its behaviour.

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTX_HOME` | agentx home | `$HOME/.agentx` |
| `AGENTX_LIBRARY` | the library | `$HOME/.agents/skills` |
| `HOME` | the user's home; agent client paths derive from it | required |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | where agent clients keep user-scope configuration | `$HOME/.config` |
| `AGENTX_PLATFORM_ID` | the platform id the machine id is derived from; set it empty to declare that the machine has none | the operating system's platform id, see [Machine identity](#machine-identity) |
| `AGENTX_HOSTNAME` | the default machine label | the operating system's hostname |
| `AGENTX_INSTANCE_ID` | the `instance_id` carried by snapshots, so a script can fix it | a fresh random id per process |

## Streams

Without `--json`, stdout carries plain aligned text and stderr carries log lines as `level: message`.

With `--json`, stdout carries only events, one JSON object per line, and nothing else. Stderr carries log events in the same envelope. A consumer reads the exit code before trusting either stream.

## Event envelope

Every event is one JSON object with at least:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | string | the event type |
| `schema_version` | integer | the output schema version, currently `1` |

`schema_version` changes when an event changes incompatibly. A consumer refuses a CLI whose schema version it does not know.

## Event types

Every run emits exactly one `result` as its last stdout event, after any `error`.

`version`, emitted by `agentx version`:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `cli_version` | string | the CLI version, `dev` for an unreleased build |

`settings`, emitted by every `agentx config` command:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `settings` | object | the machine settings as they now are, in the shape of the settings file below, with `label` filled in from the hostname when it is not set |

`machine`, emitted by every `agentx machine` command:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | the machine id, 32 lowercase hex characters |
| `label` | string | the machine label |
| `derivation` | string | `platform` when the id is derived from the platform id, `random` when it comes from `machine.json` |

`error`, emitted when a command fails:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | string | the string code of the exit code table below |
| `message` | string | what went wrong, naming the path or command involved |
| `hint` | string | how to fix it; absent when there is nothing to suggest |

`result`, the terminating event:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | boolean | whether the command succeeded; the exit code is 0 exactly when it is `true` |
| `summary` | string | one line about the outcome; on failure the error message; absent when empty |

`log`, written to stderr:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `level` | string | the log level; `debug` lines appear only with `--verbose` |
| `message` | string | the log line |

`snapshot`, emitted by `agentx scan`, is described under [Snapshot](#snapshot).

The other event types are `progress`, `reconcile`, `configuration`, `skill`, `mcp_server`, `plugin`, `doctor`, `search`, `refresh_complete`, `drift`, `update_available` and `conflict`. Their fields are added to this document by the command that first emits them. `operation` and `fleet` are reserved and never emitted.

## Exit codes

| Exit | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `ok` | success |
| 1 | `usage` | a usage error: unknown command, bad flag, missing argument or a required environment variable not set |
| 2 | `git` | git is missing or older than 2.40 |
| 3 | `source` | a source is unreachable or authentication failed |
| 4 | `pending_merge` | a pending merge blocks the action |
| 5 | `not_found` | a skill, source or configuration was not found |
| 6 | `refused` | a collision or an unmet precondition |
| 7 | `locked` | another agentx command holds the lock |
| 8 | `account_repo` | the account repo is unusable: missing, corrupt, or a repository format this git cannot read |
| 10 | `internal` | an internal error, including an unreadable settings file |

In JSON mode the `error` event carries the code as its `code` field.

## Agentx home

Everything the CLI keeps on the machine lives under agentx home. Durable entries survive a reinstall when the directory is retained; transient entries coordinate running commands; derived entries are rebuilt from what the machine already has.

```
~/.agentx/
  account.git/        durable   bare account repo: skills/<name> forks, managed/<name> import branches,
                                refs/agentx/merge/<name> pending merges, refs/agentx/candidate/<name>
                                update candidates, refs/agentx/sources/<id> the last fetched state of each source
  worktrees/<name>/   durable   one linked worktree per placed fork
  settings.json       durable   machine settings
  mutations/<id>.json durable   local mutation journal, kept until completion or recovery
  sync.json           durable   fleet upload protocol metadata; reserved, nothing writes it today
  ops/<ulid>.json     durable   operation records; reserved, nothing writes them today
  version             transient mutation counter, rewritten last by every mutating command
  lock                transient advisory lock: shared for local scans, exclusive for mutations and recovery
  machine.json        derived   the machine id, only where no platform identity exists
  handshakes.json     derived   last MCP signature per server
```

No agent client reads anything in agentx home except the fork worktrees, through symlinks from the library. There is no logs directory: logs go to stderr. Temporary worktrees for editor sessions live in the operating system's temporary directory.

## Machine settings

`settings.json` in agentx home holds what only this machine decides. It is read whole and written by temp file, fsync and rename while the lock is held. A missing file means defaults. An unreadable file is exit code 10 with a hint naming the path.

`agentx config list` prints every setting, `agentx config get <key>` one, and `agentx config set <key> <value>` changes `label`, `auto_push` or `accept_operations`; the booleans take `true` or `false`. An unknown key, a key that `config set` cannot change, or an invalid value is exit code 1 with a hint listing the keys. Without `--json`, `list` prints a `key  value` table and `get` prints the bare value.

`agentx config disable <id>` adds a configuration id to `disabled_configurations` and `agentx config enable <id>` removes it; both are mutations, both are no-ops when the list already has the wanted state, and both emit the `settings` event. The id must name a detected configuration (see [Snapshot](#snapshot)), else exit code 5 with a hint listing the detected ids. A detected configuration is enabled unless it is listed, so every configuration is enabled on first detection without a write.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "label": "my-laptop",
  "auto_push": false,
  "accept_operations": false,
  "disabled_configurations": ["windsurf"],
  "sources": [
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/example/skills",
      "alias": "https://github.com/example/skills-old",
      "pin": "v1.2.0",
      "last_fetched": "2026-09-18T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "copy_mode": {
    "my-skill": ["cursor"]
  }
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema_version` | the settings schema version, currently `1` |
| `label` | the machine label; absent until set with `config set label` or `machine rename`, and reported as the hostname meanwhile |
| `auto_push` | whether published forks are pushed automatically |
| `accept_operations` | reserved; whether this machine executes operations queued for it |
| `disabled_configurations` | configuration ids the user took out of the default set for explicit placements, sorted; every other detected configuration is enabled |
| `sources` | each source by canonical `url`, with optional `alias` (a second URL mapped to the canonical one), optional `pin` (a ref the source is held at) and `last_fetched` (RFC 3339) |
| `copy_mode` | skill directory name to the configuration ids that receive a copy instead of a symlink |

Git config in the account repo holds only what git owns: remotes and tracking branches.

## Machine identity

The machine id names one computer across reinstalls. It is derived, in this order:

1. When `machine.json` exists in agentx home, its `id` is the machine id and the derivation is `random`. The file is `{"id": "<32 lowercase hex characters>"}`.
2. Otherwise, when a platform id exists, the machine id is HMAC-SHA256 with the key `agentx-machine-id/v1` over the message `<platform id> LF <uid>`, where `LF` is one newline byte and `<uid>` is the numeric user id in decimal, rendered as the first 32 lowercase hex characters of the MAC. The derivation is `platform`. The platform id is `AGENTX_PLATFORM_ID` when the variable is set, else the content of `/etc/machine-id` without surrounding whitespace on Linux, else `IOPlatformUUID` from `ioreg -rd1 -c IOPlatformExpertDevice` on macOS.
3. Otherwise 16 random bytes are generated once, under the lock, stored as hex in `machine.json`, and used from then on as in 1.

`agentx machine` prints the id, the label and the derivation. `agentx machine rename <label>` sets the label in the settings file. `agentx machine reset-id` writes a new random id to `machine.json`; from then on the id is random even where a platform id exists, until the file is deleted.

## Lock and version file

Every command that changes agentx home takes an exclusive advisory `flock` on `lock` in agentx home without waiting, does its writes, rewrites `version` as its last step and releases the lock. `version` holds one decimal integer and a newline, incremented on every successful mutation (a missing file counts as 0); it is a change signal for watchers, not an ordering of snapshots. A command that finds the lock held exits at once with code 7 and a hint naming the lock file. A failed mutation leaves `version` untouched. `agentx scan` holds a shared `flock` on the same file while it reads settings and the filesystem, retrying for up to one second while a mutation holds the exclusive lock and exiting with code 7 after that; it never writes `version`. Other reading commands do not take the lock, except `agentx machine` for the one write that stores a random id; that write does not touch `version`. Taking either lock creates agentx home and its `ops` directory when they are missing; nothing writes into `ops` yet.

## Content hash

The content hash identifies one version of a skill by its content. It is SHA-256 over the following byte sequence, where `NUL` is one zero byte:

1. the frontmatter `name`, then `NUL`;
2. the frontmatter `description`, then `NUL`;
3. for every regular file under the skill directory, in bytewise order of its relative path with `/` as the separator: the relative path, `NUL`, the byte length in decimal, `NUL`, the file bytes.

A missing name or description contributes empty bytes; a missing or unparsable frontmatter counts as both missing, even though the skill is then named after its directory. A symlink inside the skill is followed when it resolves inside the skill directory and skipped with a warning otherwise: a file symlink contributes the target's bytes under the symlink's path, a directory symlink is walked under the symlink's path, and a directory symlink that points back at a directory being walked is a loop, skipped with a warning. File modes and times do not contribute. The hash is rendered as bare lowercase hex in the `content_hash` field of a skill node.

## Snapshot

`agentx scan` inventories the machine and emits one `snapshot` event: every detected agent configuration and every skill each one can see. It writes nothing. Two scans of an unchanged machine produce byte-identical events when `instance_id` is fixed.

`agentx scan --project <path>` adds the project-scope skills found under `<path>` in each detected configuration's project skills directories, read-only; `<path>` must exist, else exit code 5. `agentx scan --configuration <id>` names the configuration that changed; the id must be detected, else exit code 5 with a hint listing the detected ids, and the whole machine is scanned regardless, since a one-shot command has no earlier snapshot to reuse.

Without `--json`, the output is one section per configuration, headed `<name> (<id>)  <path>  enabled|disabled`, with one line per occurrence: skill name, kind, scope and placement path, followed by ` -> <resolved path>` for a symlink. Warnings go to stderr as `warning: <message>`.

The event:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `instance_id` | string | fresh per process, or `AGENTX_INSTANCE_ID` |
| `scan_counter` | integer | `1` for a one-shot scan |
| `machine` | object | `id`, the machine id, and `label` |
| `configurations` | array | the detected configurations, sorted by `id` |
| `skills` | array | the skill nodes, sorted by `physical_id` |
| `edges` | array | `{"from", "to"}` pairs of node ids, sorted by `from` then `to`: the machine id to each configuration, each configuration to each skill it sees |
| `warnings` | array of strings | what could not be read, sorted; a warning never fails the scan |

A configuration:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | the configuration id: the client's slug, such as `claude-code`, `cursor`, `codex`, `gemini-cli`, `windsurf`, `github-copilot` |
| `client` | string | the client's slug |
| `name` | string | the client's display name |
| `path` | string | the user-scope configuration directory; the configuration is detected because it exists |
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` when the id is in `disabled_configurations` |
| `reads_library` | boolean | whether the client reads the library directly, so a library skill needs no placement in its own directory |
| `physical_id`, `logical_id` | string | the same value, see below |

A skill node is one content version seen on this machine; the same content found through several placements is one node with several occurrences:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `physical_id`, `logical_id` | string | see below |
| `name` | string | the frontmatter `name`, or the directory name when the frontmatter is missing, unparsable or has no name |
| `description` | string | the frontmatter `description`, or empty |
| `content_hash` | string | the content hash, lowercase hex |
| `occurrences` | array | sorted by `id` |

An occurrence:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | see below |
| `configuration` | string | the configuration id |
| `path` | string | the placement path as the client sees it |
| `resolved_path` | string | the real directory after following every symlink |
| `kind` | string | `symlink` when the placement path is a symlink; `copy` when it is a real directory in user scope and `copy_mode` lists the configuration under the directory's name; `directory` for every other real directory |
| `scope` | string | `user`, or `project` under `--project` |

Discovery: inside each skills directory a client reads, every child directory, or symlink to one, that holds a `SKILL.md` is a skill; hidden entries and `node_modules` are skipped; a broken symlink is a warning. A client's user-scope skills directories are its own, other clients' directories it reads (Cursor reads the Claude Code and Codex directories) and the library for clients that read it directly (Codex and Gemini CLI), which yields an occurrence with the library path as placement path whatever the enabled state. Each directory is canonicalised once and each skill is hashed once per scan.

Identities are SHA-256 over the type name and its inputs, each input preceded by one `NUL` byte, rendered as `<type>:<lowercase hex>`. Paths under the user's home are hashed with the home replaced by `~`, so an identity does not depend on where the home directory is. Every identity but a skill's logical one includes the machine id; since the platform-derived id also covers the user id, a snapshot that must compare across users or machines, such as the CLI's own golden files, pins the id with `machine.json`.

| Identity | Inputs |
|---|---|
| machine node id | the machine id itself, no hash |
| configuration | `configuration`, machine id, configuration id, configuration path |
| skill, logical | `skill`, `content`, content hash: an unmanaged skill is its content |
| skill, physical | `skill`, logical id, machine id, content hash |
| occurrence | `occurrence`, configuration physical id, skill physical id, scope, placement path |
